[![Rubik Tac Toe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frrmack/rubik-tac-toe/master/assets/icons/meta-image.png)](https://frrmack.github.io/rubik-tac-toe/)


It's a free game designed by [Gizem Boyacıoğlu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gizemboyacioglu/), code developed by [Irmak Sirer](https://www.irmaksirer.com). 
It relies heavily on [The Cube](https://github.com/bsehovac/the-cube) code developed by [Boris Šehovac](https://github.com/bsehovac). 

The game is similar to tic-tac-toe, which is played on a 3x3 square where one player tries to make a chain of 3 **X** symbols, while the other tries to make a chain of 3 **O** symbols first. This is a three dimensional variant on a cube where layers can rotate.

- Each player has their color (Orange vs Green)
- Players put their colors on squares of a blank 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube 
- When it's a player's turn, they can do two moves, in the order they choose:
    - Color a square with their color (mandatory move)
    - Do a single rotation on the cube (optional move)
- Color chains can wrap around the corners, but have to stay on a straight line (nothing but 180 degree angles)
- The game ends: 
    - either when one player reaches a color chain of 7 squares and wins
    - or when players run out of squares without reaching a full chain and the game ends in a tie


## Play
You can play Rubik-Tac-Toe [here!](https://frrmack.github.io/rubik-tac-toe/)

This version is couch co-op, meaning both players need to play on the same screen, sitting next to each other.
