# Rubik-Tac-Toe
It's a free game designed by [Gizem Boyacıoğlu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gizemboyacioglu/), code developed by [Irmak Sirer](https://www.irmaksirer.com). 
It relies heavily on [The Cube](https://github.com/bsehovac/the-cube) code developed by [Boris Šehovac](https://github.com/bsehovac). 

The game is similar to tic-tac-toe, played on a 3x3 square where one player tries to make a chain of 3 **X** symbols, while the other tries to make a chain of 3 **O** symbols first. This is a three dimensional variant.

- Each player has their color (Green or Orange)
- Players put their colors on squares of a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube 
- When it's a player's turn, they color a square with their color, then they **may** do a single rotation on the cube
- Color chains can wrap around the corners, but have to stay on a straight line, nothing but 180 degree angles
- The game ends: 
    - either when one player reaches a color chain of 7 squares and wins
    - or when players run out of squares without reaching a full chain and the game ends in a tie


## The Code
Rubik-tac-toe uses Sass, Scss, HTML and JavaScript.


## Play
You can play Rubik-Tac-Toe [here!]()

This version is couch co-op, meaning both players need to play on the same screen, sitting next to each other.
